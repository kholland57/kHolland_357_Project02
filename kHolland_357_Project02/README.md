Comments/Errors:
- Passphrases need to be at least 3 characters long
- Passwords cannot contain the passphrase string within them when they are created or it will be deleted when the password is decrypted. For example if your password is 'goodDog123'
and your passphrase is 'Dog', when the program decrypts the password would show as good123
- When typing in input, be careful not to put an extra space at the beginning or end.


To run:
1 - Type in a number (1,2,3, or 4) when prompted by the main menu.
